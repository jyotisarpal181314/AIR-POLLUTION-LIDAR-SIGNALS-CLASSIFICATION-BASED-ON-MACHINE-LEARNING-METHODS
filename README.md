# AIR-QUALITY-INDEX- PREDECTION-BASED-ON-MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS
In this project, we try to find the air quality index of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide by evaluating their concentration percentages and comparing several machine learning methods like SVM, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Regression.

CONCLUSION

In this work, we mainly solve the problem of air pollution.
By comparison, it can be concluded that the classification accuracy can be improved by introducing the statistical features. By comparing the classification performances of SVM, LR, RF, Linear Regression, we can find that RF performs best on the PCA dataset.
