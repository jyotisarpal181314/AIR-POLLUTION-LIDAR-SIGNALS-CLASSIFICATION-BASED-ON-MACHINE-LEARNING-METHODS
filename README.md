# AIR-POLLUTION-LIDAR-SIGNALS-CLASSIFICATION-BASED-ON-MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS
In this project, we try to classify lidar signals to evaluate and find the concentration percentages of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide by comparing several machine learning methods like SVM, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Regression.
